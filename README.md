# 3D-Character-Projection-using-Kinect-V2-and-Unity3D
The user stands in front of a Kinect V2, which detects their human joints and projects them onto a 3D character. This character mimics the user's movements in real-time. Using Unity3D, a concert stage scene is created where the character performs. Various C# scripts are developed to facilitate this process, and the Kinect V2 package is imported into Unity3D to construct the character's skeleton.
